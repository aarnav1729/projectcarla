# projectcarla

## Purpose
This is the GitHub repository to highlight my work as a Software Developer for Project CARLA 
(Campus Assistant for Resources Learning and Accessibility)

## Introduction
Project CARLA is a startup student-led nonprofit organization that is focused on providing mental health and basic needs resources for children and young adults. They aim to revolutionize the way college students access basic health needs and mental health resources. The goal is to create and then subsequently sell the software to the state of Minnesota on a yearly basis, which would support students’ mental health and colleges’ student retention rate. We plan to be one of the first companies to lay the foundations for the use of AI in government systems.

## Responsibilties
1. Creating a chatbot that uses machine learning to seamlessly connect students with basic needs and mental health resources.
2. Using machine learning to write responses to students using context from hypothetical and real situations given to college staff to    create a large language model capable of reading/writing using the voice of these government employees.
3. Developing the front end UI/UX design with help from our design contractor and marketing team.
4. Building the software’s architecture along with a team of other software developers.
5. Use and learn solid project management and organization practices
